ğŸ¤– Index ğŸ¤–

ğŸ‘¾ Indexes are used to retrieve data from the database more quickly than otherwise. 

ğŸ‘¾ The users cannot see the indexes, they are just used to speed up searches/queries.

ğŸ‘» SINGLE COLUMN INDEX

ğŸ‘€ CREATE INDEX idx_city ON customers(city);

ğŸ‘» COMPOSITE INDEX

ğŸ‘€ CREATE INDEX idx_name_city ON customers(name, city);

ğŸ‘» UNIQUE INDEX

ğŸ‘€ CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_email ON customers(email);

ğŸ‘¾ Indexes are used automatically by MySQL when executing queries

ğŸ‘€ SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city = 'New York';

ğŸ‘¾ Viewing Indexes

ğŸ‘€ SHOW INDEX FROM customers;

ğŸ‘¾ Dropping Indexes

ğŸ‘€ DROP INDEX idx_city ON customers;
