🤖 NULL 🤖

👾 A field with a NULL value is a field with no value.

👾 If a field in a table is optional.
 
👾 it is possible to insert a new record or update a record without adding a value to this field. 

👾 Then, the field will be saved with a NULL value.

👾 A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. 

👾 A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation!

👾 We will have to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL to Test for NULL Values.
