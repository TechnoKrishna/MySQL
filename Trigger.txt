ðŸ¤– TRIGGER ðŸ¤–

ðŸ‘¾ Triggers in MySQL are a powerful feature that allows you to automatically execute a specified set of SQL commands when certain events occur in your database tables. 

ðŸ‘¾ These events can be INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations.

ðŸ§Ÿ SYNTAX

CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
{BEFORE | AFTER} {INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE}
ON table_name FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- SQL statements
END;

ðŸ‘¾ BEFORE Triggers: These triggers are executed before the triggering statement (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) is performed.

ðŸ‘¾ AFTER Triggers: These triggers are executed after the triggering statement is performed.

CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATETIME,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

CREATE TABLE order_audit (
    audit_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATETIME,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    action VARCHAR(10),
    action_time DATETIME
);
