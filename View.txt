ðŸ¤– VIEW ðŸ¤–

ðŸ‘¾ In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.

ðŸ‘¾ A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.

ðŸ‘¾ You can add SQL statements and functions to a view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table.

ðŸ‘» CREATE VIEW

CREATE VIEW all_people AS
SELECT name, city FROM customers
UNION
SELECT name, city FROM suppliers;

ðŸ‘¾ you can query the view just like a regular table.

SELECT * FROM all_people;

ðŸ‘» UPDATE VIEW

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW all_people AS
SELECT name, city FROM customers
UNION ALL
SELECT name, city FROM suppliers;

ðŸ‘» DELETE VIEW

DROP VIEW all_people;
